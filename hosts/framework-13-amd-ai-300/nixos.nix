# Machine-specific NixOS configuration for Framework 13 laptop (AMD AI-300 series)
#
# Objective: Centralize machine-specific configurations while keeping the rest of the config clean
# of device-specific workarounds. Machine-specific tweaks may exist in other modules when extraction
# here would be inconvenient, but this file should contain the majority of hardware-dependent configuration.
